# COE817 LAB 3 

## Description

In this lab, we implemented a hybrid key distribution protocol which consists of two phases: a public-key scheme used to distribute a master key and then a server generating a session key.

## Lab Demo

# Public and Private Key Pairs of A, B and the server

# The decrypted KA and KB

# Demonstrate if both A and B could correctly receive the same K_AB from the server. Explain your code and tell how your server socket program makes it work. The protocol is vulnerable. Why? How to solve the problem?
